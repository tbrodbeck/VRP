# Solver for the Vehicle Routing Problem
This solution uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a Nature Inspired Algorithm.

## Project structure

We added every file here, we have used for evalutation. Every file is commented and should be self-explanatory.
Necessary files for deployment are model.py, AntColonyOptimizer.py, search.py and plotting.py - from which search.py contains the most central interface for deployment and persistence.
Optional files are the ikw_*.py files, used with the ikw-grid and final_plot.py, only used for the final plot.

Additionally there is the Vehicle_Routing_Problem.pdf that contains a formal description and analysis of our code.

In general, everyone of our group worked on several aspects of the project.
